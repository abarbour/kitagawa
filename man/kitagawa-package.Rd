\title{kitagawa: Spectral Response of Water Wells to Harmonic Strain and Pressure Signals}
\description{
Provides tools to calculate the theoretical hydrodynamic response of an aquifer undergoing harmonic straining or pressurization, or analyze measured responses. There are two classes of models here, designed for use with confined aquifers: (1) for sealed wells, based on the model of Kitagawa et al (2011, \doi{10.1029/2010JB007794}), and (2) for open wells, based on the models of Cooper et al (1965, \doi{10.1029/JZ070i016p03915}), Hsieh et al (1987, \doi{10.1029/WR023i010p01824}), Rojstaczer (1988, \doi{10.1029/JB093iB11p13619}), Liu et al (1989, \doi{10.1029/JB094iB07p09453}), and Wang et al (2018, \doi{10.1029/2018WR022793}). Wang's solution is a special exception which allows for leakage out of the aquifer (semi-confined); it is equivalent to Hsieh's model when there is no leakage (the confined case). These models treat strain (or aquifer head) as an input to the physical system, and fluid-pressure (or water height) as the output. The applicable frequency band of these models is characteristic of seismic waves, atmospheric pressure fluctuations, and solid earth tides.

Provides tools to calculate the theoretical hydrodynamic response
of an aquifer undergoing harmonic straining or pressurization. There are
two classes of models here: (1) for sealed wells, based on the model of
Kitagawa et al (2011), and (2) for open wells, based on the models of
Cooper et al (1965), Hsieh et al (1987), Rojstaczer (1988), Liu et al
(1989), and Wang et al (2018). These models treat strain (or aquifer head) as 
an input to the physical system, and fluid-pressure (or water height) as the output. The
applicable frequency band of these models is characteristic of seismic
waves, atmospheric pressure fluctuations, and solid earth tides.
The Wang et al (2018) can explicitly model vertical leakage.

The following functions provide the primary features of the package:

\code{\link{well_response}} and \code{\link{open_well_response}}, which 
take in arguments for well- and aquifer-parameters, and the frequencies
at which to calculate the response functions.
They both access the constants-calculation routines as necessary, meaning
the user need not worry about those functions
(e.g., \code{\link{alpha_constants}}).

Helper functions: 
\describe{
\item{\code{\link{sensing_volume}}}{ can be used to compute the
sensing volume of fluid, for the specified well dimensions.}

\section{Scientific background}{


The underlying model is based upon the assumption that fluid flows radially
through an homogeneous, isotropic, confined aquifer.

The underlying principle is as follows.  When a harmonic wave induces
strain in a confined aquifer (one having an aquitard above and below it), 
fluid flows radially into, and out of a well penetrating the aquifer.
The flow-induced drawdown, \eqn{s}, is governed by the following 
partial differential equation, expressed in radial coordinates(\eqn{r}):
\deqn{
\frac{\partial^2 s}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} 
\frac{\partial s}{ \partial r} - \frac{S}{T}\frac{\partial s}{\partial t} = 0
}
where \eqn{S, T} are the aquifer storativity and transmissivity respectively.

The solution to this PDE, with periodic discharge boundary conditions,
gives the amplitude and phase response we wish to calculate.
The solution  for an open well was presented by
Cooper et al (1965), and subsequently modified by Liu et al (1989). 
Wang et al (2018) modified this solution for the leaky aquifer case.
Kitagawa et al (2011) adapted the solution
of Hsieh et al (1987) for the case of a sealed well.
When there is no leakage, Wang et al (2018) is
equivalent to Hsieh et al (1987).

These models are applicable to any quasi-static process involving harmonic, 
volumetric strain of an aquifer 
(e.g. passing Rayleigh waves, or changes in the Earth's tidal potential). 
In practice, however, the presence of permeable fractures can violate the
assumption of isotropic permeability, which may substantially
alter the response by introducing shear-strain coupling. But these
complications are beyond the scope of this model.
