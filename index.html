Frequency characteristics of the response of water pressure in a closed well to
volumetric strain in the high-frequency domain

Yuichi Kitagawa, Satoshi Itaba, Norio Matsumoto, and Naoji Koizumi

Oscillations of water pressures and crustal strains due to the seismic waves of
the 2010 Chile earthquake were observed in Japan. The oscillations of water
pressures observed over the frequency range of 0.002 to 0.1 Hz were negative
proportional to the oscillations of volumetric strains. The responses of water
pressures in closed wells are frequency-dependent. The expression for the
response of water pressure in a closed well to crustal strain is developed based
on the poroelastic theory. The expression developed in the present paper
describes the frequency characteristics of the responses. The response is useful
for the estimation of rock properties. In addition, the responses of water
pressure due to tidal volumetric strain are estimated and compared with the
responses due to the seismic waves.
