between fluid and strain in a closed well. The theoretical model
is from Kitagawa et al (2011)

The package is named after Yuichi Kitagawa.

	Frequency characteristics of the response of water pressure in a closed well to
	volumetric strain in the high-frequency domain

	Yuichi Kitagawa, Satoshi Itaba, Norio Matsumoto, and Naoji Koizumi

	Oscillations of water pressures and crustal strains due to the seismic waves of
	the 2010 Chile earthquake were observed in Japan. The oscillations of water
	pressures observed over the frequency range of 0.002 to 0.1 Hz were negative
	proportional to the oscillations of volumetric strains. The responses of water
	pressures in closed wells are frequency-dependent. The expression for the
	response of water pressure in a closed well to crustal strain is developed based
	on the poroelastic theory. The expression developed in the present paper
	describes the frequency characteristics of the responses. The response is useful
	for the estimation of rock properties. In addition, the responses of water
	pressure due to tidal volumetric strain are estimated and compared with the
	responses due to the seismic waves.
