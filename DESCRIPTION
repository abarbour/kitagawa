Description: Provides tools to calculate the theoretical hydrodynamic response
    of an aquifer undergoing harmonic straining or pressurization, or analyze
    measured responses. There are
    two classes of models here: (1) for sealed wells, based on the model of 
    Kitagawa et al (2011, <doi:10.1029/2010JB007794>), 
    and (2) for open wells, based on the models of
    Cooper et al (1965, <doi:10.1029/JZ070i016p03915>), 
    Hsieh et al (1987, <doi:10.1029/WR023i010p01824>), 
    Rojstaczer (1988, <doi:10.1029/JB093iB11p13619>), and 
    Liu et al (1989, <doi:10.1029/JB094iB07p09453>). These models treat 
    strain (or aquifer head) as an input to the
    physical system, and fluid-pressure (or water height) as the output. The
    applicable frequency band of these models is characteristic of seismic
    waves, atmospheric pressure fluctuations, and solid earth tides.
