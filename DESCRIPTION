Description: Provides tools to calculate the theoretical hydrodynamic response
    of an aquifer undergoing harmonic straining or pressurization. There are
    two classes of models here: (1) for sealed wells, based on the model of
    Kitagawa et al (2011), and (2) for open wells, based on the models of
    Cooper et al (1965), Hsieh et al (1987), Rojstaczer (1988), and Liu et al
    (1989). These models treat strain (or aquifer head) as an input to the
    physical system, and fluid-pressure (or water height) as the output. The
    applicable frequency band of these models is characteristic of seismic
    waves, atmospheric pressure fluctuations, and solid earth tides.
