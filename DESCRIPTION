Description: Provides tools to calculate the theoretical hydrodynamic response
    of an aquifer undergoing harmonic straining. There are two classes of
    models here: (1) for sealed wells, based on the model of Kitagawa et al
    (2011), and (2) for open wells, based on the models of Rojstaczer (1988),
    Cooper et al (1965), and Liu et al (1989). These models treat strain (or
    displacements) as an input to the physical system, and fluid-pressure (or
    water height) as the output. The applicable frequency band of the models is
    characteristic of seismic waves and tides.
