Description: Provides tools to calculate the theoretical hydrodynamic response
    of an aquifer undergoing harmonic straining. There are two classes of
    models here: (1) for sealed wells, based on the model of Kitagawa et al
    (2011), and (2) for open wells, based on the model of Cooper et al (1965)
    and Liu et al (1989). Both models treat strain as an input to the physical
    system, and fluid-pressure (or water height) as the output. The applicable
    frequency band of the models is characteristic of seismic waves.
