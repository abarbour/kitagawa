The oscillations of water\r\n\tpressures observed over the frequency range of 0.002 to 0.1 Hz were negative\r\n\tproportional to the oscillations of volumetric strains. The responses of water\r\n\tpressures in closed wells are frequency-dependent. The expression for the\r\n\tresponse of water pressure in a closed well to crustal strain is developed based\r\n\ton the poroelastic theory. The expression developed in the present paper\r\n\tdescribes the frequency characteristics of the responses. The response is useful\r\n\tfor the estimation of rock properties. In addition, the responses of water\r\n\tpressure due to tidal volumetric strain are estimated and compared with the\r\n\tresponses due to the seismic waves.\r\n\r\n\tJ. Geophys.

Cooper Jr., John D. Bredehoeft, Istavros S. Papadopulos,\r\n\tand Robert R. Bennett\r\n\r\n\tThe degree to which the water level in an open well fluctuates in response to a\r\n\tseismic wave is determined by the dimensions of the well, the transmissibility,\r\n\tstorage coefficient, and porosity of the aquifer, and the type, period, and\r\n\tamplitude of the wave. The water level responds to pressure-head fluctuations due\r\n\tto dilatation of the aquifer and to vertical motion of the well-aquifer system;\r\n\thence a wave that produces either of these can cause the water level to fluctuate.\r\n\tHowever, the response to dilatation is much larger than the response to vertical\r\n\tmotion. A solution is derived for the nonsteady drawdown in the aquifer due to a\r\n\tharmonic motion of the water level. This solution is then used in the equation of\r\n\tmotion of the water column to derive expressions for the amplification, which is\r\n\tdefined as the ratio X0/h0 (for oscillation due to dilatation) or the ratio X0/a\r\n\t(for oscillation due to vertical motion of the well-aquifer system), where X0 is\r\n\tthe amplitude of water-level fluctuation, h0 is the amplitude of pressure-head\r\n\tfluctuation, and a is the amplitude of vertical motion of well-aquifer system.\r\n\tAmplification curves are given for differing well dimensions and aquifer\r\n\tconstants.\r\n\r\n\tJ.
