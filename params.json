The oscillations of water\r\n\tpressures observed over the frequency range of 0.002 to 0.1 Hz were negative\r\n\tproportional to the oscillations of volumetric strains. The responses of water\r\n\tpressures in closed wells are frequency-dependent. The expression for the\r\n\tresponse of water pressure in a closed well to crustal strain is developed based\r\n\ton the poroelastic theory. The expression developed in the present paper\r\n\tdescribes the frequency characteristics of the responses. The response is useful\r\n\tfor the estimation of rock properties. In addition, the responses of water\r\n\tpressure due to tidal volumetric strain are estimated and compared with the\r\n\tresponses due to the seismic waves.\r\n","google":"UA-34990319-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
